Our dialog state consists of a dialog manager which executes in the following manner:

1. Parse Input - Parses the input string via calling the NLU
2. Track State - Updates the state of the Dialog Frame based on information populated into the Semantc Frame by the NLU
3. Select Dialog Act - Chooses a new dialog act to respond with, based on the new state of the Dialog Frame
4. Generate Output - Creates output to return to user based on chosen dialog act

For tracking state, we are doing such operations as noting the grounding of our pizza to order, grounding of a full order (including modality details), changes to be made to the preferred order, and updating any pizza related info the user provides, and update our Dialog Frame accordingly.  We also flag whether new information was provided to make note of any need for grounding.

Or dialog act selection is a rather straightforward determination of the type of dialog act and any extra information to be passed along within it for processing by the NLG. This is largely conditioned on what types of slot fields were identified and filled within the Semantic Frame.  This is also where we check for universal requests such as cancel, repeat, and start over that were flagged into our Dialog Frame. If nothing was explicity requested, we create a dialog act to ask the user for the pizza information that they have not provided. If their pizza is grounded already, we ask for their modality and personal details (name, address for delivery if needed).



Some notes about running our Mixed Initiative System:

-Once the pizza is grounded (confirmed by the user), pizza details cannot be changed.
-At any time before the pizza is confirmed, toppings/crust/size/pizza type can be updated by asking for them (including out of turn).
-The preferred order can be ordered by using the preferred keyword in the user's request
-The user's order status can by requested by using the status keyword in the user's request
