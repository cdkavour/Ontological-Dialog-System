Text20	Clerk	Welcome to Pizzamon , where we create pokemon themed pizzas !
Text20	User	Hi , so , what does that mean exactly ?
Text20	Clerk	So we have our Pikacheese pizza which is in the shape of pikachu ’ s head , we have squirtle ’ s seafood which is in the shape of squirtle ’ s shell , and we have bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight , which is just a veggie pizza actually .
Text20	User	Oh , interesting . What veggies are on the bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight pizza ?
Text20	Clerk	All kinds , including green bell peppers , spinach , <topping> olives </topping> , and tomatoes !
Text20	User	Hmm , what ’ s the cheapest pizza you sell ?
Text20	Clerk	The Pikacheese is the cheapest , with <size> large </size> selling for $ 12 , medium for $ 10 , and small for $ 8 .
Text20	User	How can I get the most toppings for the least amount of money ? I don ’ t want just a <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> pizza .
Text20	Clerk	You can add additional toppings of your choice for .50 a topping . So I would get <ref id='brown.91'> a Pikacheese </ref> and choose 3 toppings for <refexp id='brown.91'> it </refexp> to be cheaper than the bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight .
Text20	User	Okay , I want to do that . Can you choose 3 random veggie toppings for me ?
Text20	Clerk	How about , <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> ham </topping> , and <topping> onions </topping> ?
Text20	User	Pineapple and onion sounds good , but ham isn ’ t vegetarian . Can I have <topping> olives </topping> instead ?
Text20	Clerk	Yes I have <ref id='brown.92'> a <size> large </size> <pizza_type> Pikacheese </pizza_type> with <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> olives </topping> , and <topping> onions </topping> </ref> . Will <refexp id='brown.92'> that </refexp> be all ?
Text20	User	Yes , <refexp id='brown.92'> that </refexp> ’ s it . Is <refexp id='brown.92'> it </refexp> okay if I pay in change ?
Text20	Clerk	Sure that ’ s fine but you ’ ll have to come pick up <ref id='brown.93'> the pizza </ref> to pay with cash .
Text20	User	Okay , will <refexp id='brown.93'> it </ref> be ready in <time> 20 minutes </time> ?
Text20	Clerk	Yes , <refexp id='brown.93'> it </refexp> should be ready in <time> 20 minutes </time> .
Text20	User	Is it okay for me to come in about <time> 30 minutes </time> ?
