Spoken 2	User	Hmm , okay . So , um , and also just , I just do n't even know like , what kinds of pizzas I should order for that many people . Um like , what do you think are like the favorites here ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Most common order is plain , or <topping> pepperoni </topping>
Spoken 2	User	Just cheese or <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah .
Spoken 2	User	Okay . Um , and so would <ref id='drizin.13'> plain </ref> be like a pizza with <quant> no </quant> toppings , or would <refexp id='drizin.13'> it </refexp> be the <pizza_type> four cheese </pizza_type> in the specialty pizzas , cuz both of those , are those both just <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> or is <ref id='drizin.14'> <numeric> four </numeric> <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> </ref>, um
Spoken 2	Clerk	Extra cheese .
Spoken 2	User	Okay . Extra cheese on <refexp id='drizin.14'> that </refexp> one . Um , and also we have <refexp id='drizin.15'> somebody </refexp> who 's allergic to dairy . <refexp id='drizin.16'> It </refexp> 's just one person , but I wan na
Spoken 2	Clerk	[ interrupt ] It 's allergy ? Sorry , what was <ref id='drizin.17'> the allergy </ref> ? You said allergy ? <refexp id='drizin.18'> That </refexp> 's important I have to go get a form . Hold on . Okay . Okay . What are the allergies ?
Spoken 2	User	Dairy , so they ca n't have any pizza with <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> . I was wondering if you have any just , like , red pizza without cheese for them ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	We have <ref id='drizin.19'> a vegan pizza </ref> .
Spoken 2	User	Okay . So , so then <refexp id='drizin.19'> that one </refexp> does n't have any cheese right ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	No , that 's what vegan is .
Spoken 2	User	Okay , so I 'm gon na have to get at least one of those
Spoken 2	Clerk	Anything else ?
Spoken 2	User	Yes . So how many , how many did you say I would need again six or seven ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah .
Spoken 2	User	Okay , this is okay so you have <ref id='drizin.20'> <quant> six </quant> specialty pizzas </ref> , but <refexp id='drizin.20'> that </refexp> was not the most popular . The most popular are just plain . So I think I 'm going to get <quant> one </quant> <pizza_type> vegan </pizza_type> , <quant> two </quant> <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> , um ... hmm , I do n't know . Should I get a plain pizza with <topping> pineapple </topping> , or should I get the Hawaiian pizza ?  It 's , it 's just so hard to know what what 's gon na work for <quant> 50 </quant> people
Spoken 2	User	Um no , I 'll go with <ref id='drizin.21'> the Hawaiian </ref> people know what <refexp id='drizin.21'> that </refexp> is . So , you know , hopefully there will be some people who like <refexp id='drizin.21'> that </refexp> .
Spoken 2	Clerk	Conversation starter .
Spoken 2	User	Yeah . Yeah , true . Um , but how many am I at right now like four ? Yeah , I think I 'm at four right ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	<ref id='drizin.22'> The Hawaiian , the vegan </ref> , <refexp id='drizin.22'> those </refexp> are the <quant> two </quant> I remember , I'm- I know you have Hawaiian and vegan .
Spoken 2	User	Okay , I think , I think I had <quant> two </quant> <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> as well . So I 'm gon na need more . What 's your favorite pizza here ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Ooh , um , I mean , personally , I love <ref id='drizin.23'> the meat lovers </ref> , um , but with <topping> extra cheese </topping> . Um , but that 's just me . Um , uh , let 's see . Yeah , but I think , yeah , <refexp id='drizin.23'> that </refexp> 's my favorite . If you want to go for <refexp id='drizin.24'> that </refexp> and just , you got to know your audience , I guess , Or at least one of them . Yeah .
Spoken 2	User	Okay , so yeah , to have a <ref id='drizin.25'> vegan pizza meat lovers pizza </ref> would probably be a good idea too , um , what are the meats on <refexp id='drizin.25'> that pizza </refexp> ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Gosh , um its <ref id='drizin.26'> <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> , <topping> ham </topping> , <topping> bacon </topping> and <topping> sausage </topping> </ref> .
Spoken 2	User	Okay , okay <refexp id='drizin.26'> that </refexp> 's- <refexp id='drizin.26'> that </refexp> should work . Um , there 's something for everybody there , right ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah .
Spoken 2	User	Okay . Um , and then ... hmm . I have , hmm ... two left to get to seven so I think I 'll get some more pizzas that are n't specialty that are just toppings .
Spoken 2	User	So I see some of your toppings cost more than others . Some are <cost> two dollars </cost> and some are a dollar fifty . Do you think it 's worth it to get kind of like the premium toppings ? Or I guess the , I guess the dollar fifty toppings are just <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> . So I guess I will have to spend that extra fifty cents for toppings wo n't I ? .
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah , yeah , it 's just I do n't know on , you know the other toppings are just , you know , more expensive . I do n't make the prices but
Spoken 2	User	Yeah um , they 're not necessarily better . Oh wow , the-the meat the <topping_type> meat </topping_type> toppings are even more expensive and wow okay so this is going to get expensive with <quant> seven </quant> pizzas , um , hmm .
Spoken 2	User	Cuz I 've just been like calling different restaurants comparing prices yours look like you have the best pizzas , so I think I 'm going to place an order with you , but I wan na kind of minimize the price . So I 'm gon na go for just <ref id='drizin.27'> the toppings that are <cost> two dollars </cost> </ref> um
Spoken 2	User	So <refexp id='drizin.27'> those </refexp> are <ref id='drizin.28'> <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> green peppers </topping> , <topping> red onions </topping> , <topping> mushrooms </topping> and <topping> black olives </topping> </ref> . Right ? So I want them ( Mmm ) <quant> two </quant> pizzas that just have all of <refexp id='drizin.28'> those things </refexp> on it .
Spoken 2	Clerk	All <refexp id='drizin.28'> those </refexp> ?
Spoken 2	User	Mm hmm .
Spoken 2	Clerk	You sure ?
Spoken 2	User	Mhm .
Spoken 2	Clerk	Okay . Anything else ?
Spoken 2	User	I 'm gon na need some sides . Also the pizza crust . Should-What , what , what do you think is the best ? <ref id='drizin.29'> Thin , regular , deep-dish </ref> or just like all combinations of <refexp id='drizin.29'> all of them </refexp> ?
Spoken 2	Clerk	I mean , I personally like thin and regular . Um , but , um , for a big party maybe <ref id='drizin.30'> regular </ref> .
Spoken 2	User	Okay . Yeah <refexp id='drizin.30'> that </refexp> 's a probably good idea , the- all the combinations . Those would get so confusing , and regular is-is much cheaper than <crust> deep dish </crust> so ( oh yeah )
Spoken 2	User	Yeah , I 'm going to go for <crust> regular </crust>
Spoken 2	User	And and the sides has to be large . ( okay )
Spoken 2	User	Okay , the sides , I will get <quant> two </quant> orders of each of the sides .
Spoken 2	Clerk	What else would you like ?
