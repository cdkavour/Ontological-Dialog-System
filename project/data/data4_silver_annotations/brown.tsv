Text20	Clerk	You can add additional toppings of your choice for .50 a topping . So I would get a Pikacheese and choose 3 toppings for it to be cheaper than the bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight .
Text20	User	Okay , I want to do that . Can you choose 3 random veggie toppings for me ?
Text20	Clerk	How about , <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> ham </topping> , and <topping> onions </topping> ?

Text20	Clerk	Yes I have a <size> large </size> <pizza_type> Pikacheese </pizza_type> with <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> olives </topping> , and <topping> onions </topping> . Will that be all ?
Text20	User	Yes , that ’ s it . Is it okay if I pay in change ?
Text20	Clerk	Sure that ’ s fine but you ’ ll have to come pick up the pizza to pay with cash .
Text20	User	Okay , will it be ready in <time> 20 minutes </time> ?
Text20	Clerk	Yes , it should be ready in <time> 20 minutes </time> .
Text20	User	Is it okay for me to come in about <time> 30 minutes </time> ?
