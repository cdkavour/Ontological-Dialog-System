589	Text19	Clerk	Adios !
590	Text20	Clerk	Welcome to Pizzamon , where we create pokemon themed pizzas !
591	Text20	User	Hi , so , what does that mean exactly ?
592	Text20	Clerk	So we have our Pikacheese pizza which is in the shape of pikachu ’ s head , we have squirtle ’ s seafood which is in the shape of squirtle ’ s shell , and we have bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight , which is just a veggie pizza actually .
593	Text20	User	Oh , interesting . What veggies are on the bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight pizza ?
594	Text20	Clerk	All kinds , including green bell peppers , spinach , <topping> olives </topping> , and tomatoes !
595	Text20	User	Hmm , what ’ s the cheapest pizza you sell ?
596	Text20	Clerk	The Pikacheese is the cheapest , with <size> large </size> selling for $ 12 , medium for $ 10 , and small for $ 8 .
597	Text20	User	How can I get the most toppings for the least amount of money ? I don ’ t want just a <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> pizza .
598	Text20	Clerk	You can add additional toppings of your choice for .50 a topping . So I would get a Pikacheese and choose 3 toppings for it to be cheaper than the bulbasaur ’ s veggie delight .
599	Text20	User	Okay , I want to do that . Can you choose 3 random veggie toppings for me ?
600	Text20	Clerk	How about , <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> ham </topping> , and <topping> onions </topping> ?
601	Text20	User	Pineapple and onion sounds good , but ham isn ’ t vegetarian . Can I have <topping> olives </topping> instead ?
602	Text20	Clerk	Yes I have a <size> large </size> <pizza_type> Pikacheese </pizza_type> with <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> olives </topping> , and <topping> onions </topping> . Will that be all ?
603	Text20	User	Yes , that ’ s it . Is it okay if I pay in change ?
604	Text20	Clerk	Sure that ’ s fine but you ’ ll have to come pick up the pizza to pay with cash .
605	Text20	User	Okay , will it be ready in <time> 20 minutes </time> ?
606	Text20	Clerk	Yes , it should be ready in <time> 20 minutes </time> .
607	Text20	User	Is it okay for me to come in about <time> 30 minutes </time> ?
608	Text20	Clerk	Yes . See you in <time> 30 minutes </time> .
