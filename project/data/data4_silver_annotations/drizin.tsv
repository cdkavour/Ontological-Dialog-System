42	Spoken 2	Clerk	Tony 's Pizza .
43	Spoken 2	User	Hi um I 'm throwing a graduation party for my brother , um , it 's actually at the end of the week , but I 'm shopping around for prices now . Um , how much do you , how many pizzas Do you think I would need for <quant> 50 </quant> people ?
44	Spoken 2	Clerk	Ummm , say six or seven to be safe .
45	Spoken 2	User	Okay . Um , and what size would those need to be ?
46	Spoken 2	Clerk	Large
47	Spoken 2	User	Okay . Um , what is the price of your <size> large </size> pizzas and is this the store . I saw coupons online for ?
48	Spoken 2	User	Do you have any coupons or ?
49	Spoken 2	Clerk	We generally do n't . Um , we have a program for customers that come in a lot like rewards . So if you sign up for that and buy pizzas , you 'll get points .
50	Spoken 2	User	Hmm , okay . So , um , and also just , I just do n't even know like , what kinds of pizzas I should order for that many people . Um like , what do you think are like the favorites here ?
51	Spoken 2	Clerk	Most common order is plain , or <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type>
52	Spoken 2	User	Just cheese or <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> ?
53	Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah .
54	Spoken 2	User	Okay . Um , and so would plain be like a pizza with <quant> no </quant> toppings , or would it be the <pizza_type> four cheese </pizza_type> in the specialty pizzas , cuz both of those , are those both just cheese or is <numeric> four </numeric> <pizza_type> cheese </pizza_type> , um
55	Spoken 2	Clerk	Extra cheese .
56	Spoken 2	User	Okay . Extra cheese on that one . Um , and also we have somebody who 's allergic to dairy . It 's just one person , but I wan na
57	Spoken 2	Clerk	[ interrupt ] It 's allergy ? Sorry , what was the allergy ? You said allergy ? That 's important I have to go get a form . Hold on . Okay . Okay . What are the allergies ?
58	Spoken 2	User	Dairy , so they ca n't have any pizza with <topping> cheese </topping> . I was wondering if you have any just , like , red pizza without cheese for them ?
59	Spoken 2	Clerk	We have a vegan pizza .
60	Spoken 2	User	Okay . So , so then that one does n't have any cheese right ?
61	Spoken 2	Clerk	No , that 's what vegan is .
62	Spoken 2	User	Okay , so I 'm gon na have to get at least one of those
63	Spoken 2	Clerk	Anything else ?
64	Spoken 2	User	Yes . So how many , how many did you say I would need again six or seven ?
65	Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah .
66	Spoken 2	User	Okay , this is okay so you have <quant> six </quant> specialty pizzas , but that was not the most popular . The most popular are just plain . So I think I 'm going to get <quant> one </quant> <pizza_type> vegan </pizza_type> , <quant> two </quant> <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> , um ... hmm , I do n't know . Should I get a plain pizza with <topping> pineapple </topping> , or should I get the Hawaiian pizza ? It 's , it 's just so hard to know what what 's gon na work for <quant> 50 </quant> people
67	Spoken 2	User	Um no , I 'll go with the Hawaiian people know what that is . So , you know , hopefully there will be some people who like that .
68	Spoken 2	Clerk	Conversation starter .
69	Spoken 2	User	Yeah . Yeah , true . Um , but how many am I at right now like four ? Yeah , I think I 'm at four right ?
70	Spoken 2	Clerk	The Hawaiian , the vegan , those are the <quant> two </quant> I remember , I'm- I know you have Hawaiian and vegan .
71	Spoken 2	User	Okay , I think , I think I had <quant> two </quant> <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> as well . So I 'm gon na need more . What 's your favorite pizza here ?
72	Spoken 2	Clerk	Ooh , um , I mean , personally , I love the meat lovers , um , but with extra cheese . Um , but that 's just me . Um , uh , let 's see . Yeah , but I think , yeah , that 's my favorite . If you want to go for that and just , you got to know your audience , I guess , Or at least one of them . Yeah .
73	Spoken 2	User	Okay , so yeah , to have a vegan pizza meat lovers pizza would probably be a good idea too , um , what are the meats on that pizza ?
74	Spoken 2	Clerk	Gosh , um its <pizza_type> pepperoni </pizza_type> , <topping> ham </topping> , <topping> bacon </topping> and <topping> sausage </topping> .
75	Spoken 2	User	Okay , okay that's- that should work . Um , there 's something for everybody there , right ?
76	Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah .
77	Spoken 2	User	Okay . Um , and then ... hmm . I have , hmm ... two left to get to seven so I think I 'll get some more pizzas that are n't specialty that are just toppings .
78	Spoken 2	User	So I see some of your toppings cost more than others . Some are <cost> two dollars </cost> and some are a dollar fifty . Do you think it 's worth it to get kind of like the premium toppings ? Or I guess the , I guess the dollar fifty toppings are just cheese . So I guess I will have to spend that extra fifty cents for toppings wo n't I ? .
79	Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah , yeah , it 's just I do n't know on , you know the other toppings are just , you know , more expensive . I do n't make the prices but
80	Spoken 2	User	Yeah um , they 're not necessarily better . Oh wow , the-the meat the <topping_type> meat </topping_type> toppings are even more expensive and wow okay so this is going to get expensive with <quant> seven </quant> pizzas , um , hmm .
81	Spoken 2	User	Cuz I 've just been like calling different restaurants comparing prices yours look like you have the best pizzas , so I think I 'm going to place an order with you , but I wan na kind of minimize the price . So I 'm gon na go for just the toppings that are <cost> two dollars </cost> um
82	Spoken 2	User	So those are <topping> pineapple </topping> , <topping> green peppers </topping> , <topping> red onions </topping> , <topping> mushrooms </topping> and <topping> black olives </topping> . Right ? So I want them ( Mmm ) <quant> two </quant> pizzas that just have all of those things on it .
83	Spoken 2	Clerk	All those ?
84	Spoken 2	User	Mm hmm .
85	Spoken 2	Clerk	You sure ?
86	Spoken 2	User	Mhm .
87	Spoken 2	Clerk	Okay . Anything else ?
88	Spoken 2	User	I 'm gon na need some sides . Also the pizza crust . Should-What , what , what do you think is the best ? Thin , regular , deep-dish or just like all combinations of all of them ?
89	Spoken 2	Clerk	I mean , I personally like thin and regular . Um , but , um , for a big party maybe regular .
90	Spoken 2	User	Okay . Yeah that 's a probably good idea , the- all the combinations . Those would get so confusing , and regular is-is much cheaper than <crust> deep dish </crust> so ( oh yeah )
91	Spoken 2	User	Yeah , I 'm going to go for <crust> regular </crust>
92	Spoken 2	User	And and the sides has to be large . ( okay )
93	Spoken 2	User	Okay , the sides , I will get <quant> two </quant> orders of each of the sides .
94	Spoken 2	Clerk	What else would you like ?
95	Spoken 2	User	Um
96	Spoken 2	User	I think I 'll also get <quant> three </quant> <beverage> colas </beverage> and <quant> two </quant> <beverage> orange sodas </beverage> .
97	Spoken 2	Clerk	And is this . So we have a size limit um for <modality> delivery </modality> . Once it gets this big it 's goes to catering , um , to- so- um , and there 's like a fee for catering , so do you want to go that way or just <modality> pick up </modality>
98	Spoken 2	User	I , I think I should <modality> pick up </modality> because is it- is this okay this is actually for-for Friday , which is like five or six days from now . Um , but I just wanted to call ahead and make sure this was all , you know I could that I could afford it for this party and that it um , that I would like the pizzas .
