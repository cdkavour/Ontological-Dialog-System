Spoken 1	Clerk	You want a pizza? What kind of pizza would you like?
Spoken 1	User	Can I have the Hawaiian pizza please?
Spoken 1	Clerk	"The Hawaiian pizza, that comes with pineapple ham mozzarella. Um, What size would you like that?"
Spoken 1	User	"Um, how many people does the large serve?"
Spoken 1	Clerk	"Um so large is 14 inches. So, I mean, if you cut them up real thin, you could probably get like up to 20 people. But we usually say around like anywhere from eight to 10 people"
Spoken 1	User	"Okay, that's perfect. Thank you. And how much does that one cost?"
Spoken 1	Clerk	"That one... Um, it depends on the cross thinness. Um, so like if you just want like a plain pizza, it's fourteen dollars um but if you were to get deep dish or gluten free that's sixteen or twenty-one respectively."
Spoken 1	User	"Okay, can I get the regular please?"
Spoken 1	Clerk	"Alright r-regular, large Hawaiian pizza. Did you want any additional toppings?"

Spoken 2	Clerk	Tony's Pizza.
Spoken 2	User	"Hi um I'm throwing a graduation party for my brother, um, it's actually at the end of the week, but I'm shopping around for prices now. Um, how much do you, how many pizzas Do you think I would need for 50 people?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"Ummm, say six or seven to be safe."
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. Um, and what size would those need to be?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	Large
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. Um, what is the price of your large pizzas and is this the store. I saw coupons online for?"
Spoken 2	User	Do you have any coupons or?
Spoken 2	Clerk	"We generally don't. Um, we have a program for customers that come in a lot like rewards. So if you sign up for that and buy pizzas, you'll get points."
Spoken 2	User	"Hmm, okay. So, um, and also just, I just don't even know like, what kinds of pizzas I should order for that many people. Um like, what do you think are like the favorites here?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"Most common order is plain, or pepperoni"
Spoken 2	User	Just cheese or pepperoni?
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah.
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. Um, and so would plain be like a pizza with no toppings, or would it be the four cheese in the specialty pizzas, cuz both of those, are those both just cheese or is four cheese, um"
Spoken 2	Clerk	Extra cheese.
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. Extra cheese on that one. Um, and also we have somebody who's allergic to dairy. It's just one person, but I wanna"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"[interrupt]It's allergy? Sorry, what was the allergy? You said allergy? That's important I have to go get a form. Hold on. Okay. Okay. What are the allergies?"
Spoken 2	User	"Dairy, so they can't have any pizza with cheese. I was wondering if you have any just, like, red pizza without cheese for them?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	We have a vegan pizza.
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. So, so then that one doesn't have any cheese right?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"No, that's what vegan is."
Spoken 2	User	"Okay, so I'm gonna have to get at least one of those"
Spoken 2	Clerk	Anything else?
Spoken 2	User	"Yes. So how many, how many did you say I would need again six or seven?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah.
Spoken 2	User	"Okay, this is okay so you have six specialty pizzas, but that was not the most popular. The most popular are just plain. So I think I'm going to get one vegan, two pepperoni, um...hmm, I don't know. Should I get a plain pizza with pineapple, or should I get the Hawaiian pizza? It's, it's just so hard to know what what's gonna work for 50 people"
Spoken 2	User	"Um no, I'll go with the Hawaiian people know what that is. So, you know, hopefully there will be some people who like that."
Spoken 2	Clerk	Conversation starter.
Spoken 2	User	"Yeah. Yeah, true. Um, but how many am I at right now like four? Yeah, I think I'm at four right?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"The Hawaiian, the vegan, those are the two I remember, I'm- I know you have Hawaiian and vegan."
Spoken 2	User	"Okay, I think, I think I had two pepperoni as well. So I'm gonna need more. What's your favorite pizza here?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"Ooh, um, I mean, personally, I love the meat lovers, um, but with extra cheese. Um, but that's just me. Um, uh, let's see. Yeah, but I think, yeah, that's my favorite. If you want to go for that and just, you got to know your audience, I guess, Or at least one of them. Yeah."
Spoken 2	User	"Okay, so yeah, to have a vegan pizza meat lovers pizza would probably be a good idea too, um, what are the meats on that pizza?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"Gosh, um its pepperoni, ham, bacon and sausage."
Spoken 2	User	"Okay, okay that's- that should work. Um, there's something for everybody there, right?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	Yeah.
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. Um, and then...hmm. I have, hmm...two left to get to seven so I think I'll get some more pizzas that aren't specialty that are just toppings."
Spoken 2	User	"So I see some of your toppings cost more than others. Some are two dollars and some are a dollar fifty. Do you think it's worth it to get kind of like the premium toppings? Or I guess the, I guess the dollar fifty toppings are just cheese. So I guess I will have to spend that extra fifty cents for toppings won't I?."
Spoken 2	Clerk	"Yeah, yeah, it's just I don't know on, you know the other toppings are just, you know, more expensive. I don't make the prices but"
Spoken 2	User	"Yeah um, they're not necessarily better. Oh wow, the-the meat the meat toppings are even more expensive and wow okay so this is going to get expensive with seven pizzas, um, hmm."
Spoken 2	User	"Cuz I've just been like calling different restaurants comparing prices yours look like you have the best pizzas, so I think I'm going to place an order with you, but I wanna kind of minimize the price. So I'm gonna go for just the toppings that are two dollars um"
Spoken 2	User	"So those are pineapple, green peppers, red onions, mushrooms and black olives. Right? So I want them ( Mmm) two pizzas that just have all of those things on it."
Spoken 2	Clerk	All those?
Spoken 2	User	Mm hmm.
Spoken 2	Clerk	You sure?
Spoken 2	User	Mhm.
Spoken 2	Clerk	Okay. Anything else?
Spoken 2	User	"I'm gonna need some sides. Also the pizza crust. Should-What, what, what do you think is the best? Thin, regular, deep-dish or just like all combinations of all of them?"
Spoken 2	Clerk	"I mean, I personally like thin and regular. Um, but, um, for a big party maybe regular."
Spoken 2	User	"Okay. Yeah that's a probably good idea, the- all the combinations. Those would get so confusing, and regular is-is much cheaper than deep dish so ( oh yeah)"
Spoken 2	User	"Yeah, I'm going to go for regular"
Spoken 2	User	And and the sides has to be large. ( okay)
Spoken 2	User	"Okay, the sides, I will get two orders of each of the sides."
Spoken 2	Clerk	What else would you like?
Spoken 2	User	Um
Spoken 2	User	I think I'll also get three colas and two orange sodas.
Spoken 2	Clerk	"And is this. So we have a size limit um for delivery. Once it gets this big it's goes to catering, um, to- so- um, and there's like a fee for catering, so do you want to go that way or just pick up"
Spoken 2	User	"I, I think I should pick up because is it- is this okay this is actually for-for Friday, which is like five or six days from now. Um, but I just wanted to call ahead and make sure this was all, you know I could that I could afford it for this party and that it um, that I would like the pizzas."

Spoken 5	Clerk	They shouldn't be worried. As long as they don't eat the Veggie Supreme pizza.
Spoken 5	User	Okay.
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Or the vegan pizza, but I don't think you ordered that one."
Spoken 5	User	"Okay, um, uh, what else did I need, um, and then could I also get five bread stick and six cheese sticks, um, and then four of just, or just like one of each soda I guess, or four of the best sodas? Do four of the best. Surprise me."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay, um, and let me just repeat all that back to you too. I just want to make sure we have your order correct. You said five bread sticks, six cheese sticks, and you'd like four of the best sodas. So, when you say that, do you want, uh just the ones people order the most often?"
Spoken 5	User	"Sure, surprise me, yeah. That works."
Spoken 5	Clerk	Okay. So a random combination. Um
Spoken 5	User	"Yeah. Why not, why not?"
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Um, mineral water, I don't know if you want that to be included, because it's not technically a soda."
Spoken 5	User	"No, no, no."
Spoken 5	Clerk	Okay.
Spoken 5	User	"It's mineral water, not soda."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay, so then all of the other beverages each cost 3.50, so"
Spoken 5	User	"Those are fine, yep."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay, um, so now, is that everything, or is there more?"
Spoken 5	User	"Um, that's good."
Spoken 5	Clerk	Okay.
Spoken 5	User	"No, we're good."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"For, for the pizzas, what kind of crust did you want? We have thin, regular, deep dish, and gluten-free."
Spoken 5	User	"Um, like what's the difference?"
Spoken 5	Clerk	"So, thin is the thinnest crust, um, it's, it's very thin. Um, it's more crunchy than the other crusts. Regular is probably just, you know, like whatever comes to mind when you normally think of pizza, deep dish, is a, an especially thick crust, and uh yeah, and then the gluten-free is regular but it just doesn't have any gluten in it."
Spoken 5	User	"Uh, regular, all of them."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay, um, so now, I can repeat your whole order back to you, is that okay?"
Spoken 5	User	Go for it.
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay, so you wanted one um, large pepperoni, one small vegan supreme, and these are all regular, um, one medium meat lovers with extra pineapple, um, so actually meat lovers doesn't have pineapple, do you just want me to add pineapple to that?"
Spoken 5	User	"That would be, yeah."
Spoken 5	Clerk	Okay.
Spoken 5	User	What I asked for.
Spoken 5	Clerk	"So then, um, two four cheese, four cheese pizzas, and they're both large, and also regular, and you have five bread sticks, six cheese sticks, and four random drinks, um, that aren't mineral water. Is that everything?"
Spoken 5	User	"That all sounds fine. It sounds, it sounds like it'll be good. It's not my credit card."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay, um, yeah, so do you want me to tell you your total?"
Spoken 5	User	"No, I don't need to know. It's good."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Okay. Um, and, so, did you want this pickup or delivery?"
Spoken 5	User	"Do you deliver to like, if we had a party, you could just bring it all, I don't have to come get it?"
Spoken 5	Clerk	Do we deliver to where?
Spoken 5	User	Like parties.
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Oh to parties. Yeah, we deliver anywhere within a five mile radius."
Spoken 5	User	"If we're like, like is 5.5 miles doable? You know, since it's such a big order?"
Spoken 5	Clerk	"Yeah, we, we, we can bend the rules a little bit for that, especially since it's such a large order, we like to reward our CUSTOMERs."
Spoken 5	User	"Neat. Well it sounds good. Anything, am I good? Can I go? I got stuff to do, you know."
Spoken 5	Clerk	"And do you want to pay for it now, or later?"
Spoken 5	User	"Uh, I'll pay for it later."
Spoken 5	Clerk	Okay.
Spoken 5	User	Later's fine.
