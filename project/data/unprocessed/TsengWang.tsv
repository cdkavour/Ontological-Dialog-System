Spoken2	User	" Mm-hmm, yeah."
Spoken2	Clerk	" Is there any else, any other things that we should not put on the pizza that we might usually put otherwise?"
Spoken2	User	" Uhh, um just uh make sure to uh not put too much cheese either."
Spoken2	Clerk	 Okay. I assume someone’s lactose intolerant?
Spoken2	User	 Yup. Mm-hmm.
Spoken2	Clerk	" Okay. In that case, um do you want us to put on a different variant of cheese? We have a new form of cheese that is based on vegetables that doesn’t really have lactose in it."

Spoken2	User	 That sounds really good. Thanks for the offer.
Spoken2	Clerk	" Okay, um, how about drinks?"

Spoken3	Clerk	" That’s, that’s a weird combination."
Spoken3	User	 Yeah.
Spoken3	Clerk	 You know meatball is our signature dish? Why don’t you try meatball instead?
Spoken3	User	" Uh, yeah, sure! I guess I’ll go with that then."
Spoken3	Clerk	" Okay, meatball pizza. I’m assuming it’s a large pizza?"
Spoken3	User	" Uh yeah, large pizza."
Spoken3	Clerk	" Okay, cool. People who order this pizza usually go with, like, a large bottle of Coke and some fries. Should I add that to your bill?"
Spoken3	User	 Uh yeah that sounds great.
Spoken3	Clerk	 How about dessert?
Spoken3	User	" Uhh, I, um, no, no dessert."
Spoken3	Clerk	 Okay. You sure you don’t want any? Like we have our signature brownies that just fresh out of the oven.
Spoken3	User	" Well, I guess uh two brownies would sound good."
Spoken3	Clerk	 Okay.
Spoken3	User	 Mm-hmm.

Spoken4	Clerk	 Hi this is Domino’s. What would you like?
Spoken4	User	" Just like, uh you know, a regular pizza. You know, those with the good ol meatballs."
Spoken4	Clerk	" Okay, um, would that be all?"
Spoken4	User	" Uh, what else do you have to go with it? I mean, I can’t just eat pizza, right? That-that-those things are dry."
Spoken4	Clerk	" Yeah, that’s—that’s true. Uh sorry, sir, please hold on. Um you can also order some fries with it, we have um a special discount on large fries today."
Spoken4	User	 Uhh
Spoken4	Clerk	 If that sounds alright with you?
Spoken4	User	" Um fries, um I don’t think that’s a good idea. Maybe can I have salad?"
Spoken4	Clerk	" Uh, yes, of course. Um would you like a large or small salad?"
Spoken4	User	" Uhh I’m really feeling-feeling like a medium salad, but uhh maybe a large salad will go fine."
Spoken4	Clerk	" That sounds good, sir."
Spoken4	User	 Yeah.
Spoken4	Clerk	 Um would you like any drinks with that?
Spoken4	User	" Um wait, I-I think you haven’t asked me what I want – what I want with my salad, right?"
Spoken4	Clerk	" Uh, yes, uh, sorry—"
Spoken4	User	" Kind of rude, you know?"
Spoken4	Clerk	" Yeah. I apologize, sir. What would you like with your salad?"
Spoken4	User	" Um, I will just like some um thousand island sauce, and maybe some croutons."
Spoken4	Clerk	 Mm-hmm. Anything else?
Spoken4	User	 Maybe double the serving of croutons.
Spoken4	Clerk	" We can do that for you, sir."
Spoken4	User	" Okay, cool. Can you guys arrive in half an hour?"
Spoken4	Clerk	"Uh, at best we-  I’m afraid we can only do uh 45 minutes. Would that be alright?"
Spoken4	User	 Eh I’m feeling really hungry right now. Can you just ask your-your delivery men to-to hurry up?
Spoken4	Clerk	" Uh yes, we – we can – I can see what I can do. Mm-hmm. Where is your address?"

Spoken5	User	"  Um, no I don’t need that. I think it’ll just take more time. Um could you just deliver to me my pizza as soon as possible?"

Spoken5	User	" Not really, that’s fine."

Spoken5	User	" Because I’ll be leaving my house in an hour, so I-I need to finish that before I go."
Spoken5	Clerk	" Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I totally hear you. But did you know if you add another topping, you can get a discount on that?"
Spoken5	User	" That’s fine, it’s fine. Yeah, I-I-I, yeah, I don’t need an additional topping, that’s fine, yeah."

Spoken6	Clerk	 Welcome to Domino’s. How can I help you?
Spoken6	User	"Uh, I have – I saw – I saw the flyer that you have this really great dough for $5.99 for two large pizzas. Is that true?"
Spoken6	Clerk	 That is true.
Spoken6	User	 Okay!
Spoken6	Clerk	" But you’re going to have to wait a little extra for that, if you wanna use this dough ‘cause we just ran out and we’re going to have to bake a fresh batch and that could take a little extra time, if that’s alright with you, sir."
Spoken6	User	" Yeah, that-that’s alright."
Spoken6	Clerk	 Mm-hmm.
Spoken6	User	 Um is there any restrictions on the toppings I can have?
Spoken6	Clerk	 Uhh you can order up to three um with no extra cost but every one after has one dollar more.
Spoken6	User	" Okay, so I would like some pepperoni, some peppers, and maybe some chicken bites."
Spoken6	Clerk	" Oh I’m sorry, sir, but we’re actually out of chicken bites. Can I offer you um our alt-alternatives, the salami?"
Spoken6	User	 Uh yeah sure that goes well as well.
Spoken6	Clerk	 Mm-hmm.
Spoken6	User	 Are there any discounts you have besides?
Spoken6	Clerk	 I can check right now. Um I see that we have a discount on large fries.
Spoken6	User	 Uh what kind of seasoning do you go with it? Like the —
Spoken6	Clerk	" Uh, uh I’m afraid that we’ve actually ran out on most of our seasonings. Right now we have only cayenne pepper as available option for you, sir."
Spoken6	User	" Well I don’t really like cayenne pepper but since it’s so cheap, I’ll just take it. Um."
Spoken6	Clerk	 Mm-hmm.
Spoken6	User	" Any other things on discount? Just on a really tight budget, you know?"
Spoken6	Clerk	" Uh-huh, yeah, I totally understand, sir. Um let’s see, for a small salad, you-you can get it at half price right now, but uh I have to warn you that we’re also out of croutons right now and the only sauce available is ranch. It’s the end of the week, you understand, we’re-we kind of ran out of ingredients. Mm-hmm."
Spoken6	User	" Okay. Um, yeah, it’s fine. Yeah I’m-I’m fine with ranch sauce. I’ll take it. Yeah."
Spoken6	Clerk	 Mm-hmm.
Spoken6	User	" And uh for delivery, um is-is it-is it free?"
Spoken6	Clerk	 Uh it is free if you live within five kilometers of this restaurant.
Spoken6	User	"So I live at Avenue 123, could you help me to check if it’s um –"
Spoken6	Clerk	" Mm-hmm, I can check for you right now."
Spoken6	User	 Yeah.
Spoken6	Clerk	"Mm-hmm. You’re in luck sir, you are conveniently right at 4km."
Spoken6	User	" Okay, um, I think the last thing I want to go with my meal is some drinks. Um what is the cheapest option you have?"
Spoken6	Clerk	 The cheapest option is water.
Spoken6	User	" Um well I have water at home. I just want some soda, you know."
Spoken6	Clerk	 Uh the only available soda right now is uh sprite and coke.
Spoken6	User	 Do you have the diet versions of that?
Spoken6	Clerk	 Um I’m afraid we don’t.
Spoken6	User	 Oh okay. How much is it?
Spoken6	Clerk	It is 2 dollars.
Spoken6	User	 Oh can you do lower?
Spoken6	Clerk	" Um, we-I can do lower if you buy um an extra side of um small fries?"
Spoken6	User	 Yeah. And how much would that be?
Spoken6	Clerk	Uh just $1.5.
Spoken6	User	 Uh how - so what-what’s the net discount I get for my drink?
Spoken6	Clerk	Uh 50 cents.
Spoken6	User	" Um, sounds like a good deal. I’ll-I’ll take it."
Spoken6	Clerk	 Yeah. Sounds good—
Spoken6	User	 How long would delivery take?
Spoken6	Clerk	 It’ll only take about thirty minutes.
Spoken6	User	" Okay, see you later. Bye!"

Text3	User	 Yes that’ll be very helpful
Text3	Clerk	In fact I think the best way is to order 2 medium pizzas instead. Usually that will be a bit more expensive but I’ll apply a special coupon for you. This will make it the same price for you
